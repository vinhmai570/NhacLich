## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A family organizer creates a family calendar to track important lunar dates like memorial days (gi·ªó), birthdays, and ceremonies. They set up automatic notifications to be sent to multiple family members via email, SMS, and push notifications at configurable lead times (days, weeks, or months before events). The system automatically converts lunar dates to gregorian equivalents each year, handling leap months correctly.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Create Annual Lunar Memorial Event**
1. **Given** a family organizer is logged in with a family group created, **When** they create a memorial event on lunar date 15/07 with annual recurrence, **Then** the system converts it to the correct gregorian date and schedules yearly recurring reminders

**Scenario 2: Monthly Ritual Notifications**
2. **Given** an individual user has configured a monthly ritual on lunar day 10, **When** the lunar calendar advances, **Then** the system sends reminders 1-2 days before at the specified time (e.g., 07:00)

**Scenario 3: Long-term Event Planning**
3. **Given** an event planner creates a client event with 3-month lead notification, **When** the reminder time arrives, **Then** all specified recipients receive notifications via their chosen channels (email/SMS/push)

**Scenario 4: Family Collaboration**
4. **Given** a family group with Owner/Editor/Viewer roles, **When** an Editor adds a birthday event, **Then** all members can view the event but only Editors and Owners can modify it

**Scenario 5: Calendar Integration Export**
5. **Given** a user has created multiple events, **When** they export to ICS format, **Then** they can successfully import the events into Google Calendar, Outlook, or Apple Calendar

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a lunar date falls in a leap month and needs to carry over to the next year?
- How does system handle notification failures (email bounce, SMS delivery failure)?
- What occurs when multiple family members try to edit the same event simultaneously?
- How are timezone differences handled for recipients in different locations?
- What happens when external calendar sync fails or returns conflicts?
